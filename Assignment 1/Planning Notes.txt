random notes on assignment implementation:
- create a master class for the grid
- master class for the lists?
- list class could have a smart pointer just for inserting stuff into the list
- sort function for lists
- open and closed list as children of master list class?
- expand node function
- pathfinder class could maybe own open and closed list?


classes:
- list
- closed list :: list
- open list :: list
- node
- grid
- pathfinder (kind of like an iterator, you could potentially drop it into all sorts of structures I guess)
- 

Node:
- base individual unit of data
- put into lists and grids n shit

List:
- Highly manipulable list with lots of functions, sorting, etc.
- holds nodes

Grid:
- 2D container for nodes

Pathfinder:
- Has a pointer to a grid
- Holds open and closed list
- Open and closed lists hold pointers to nodes
